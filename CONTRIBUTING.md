### Issues & Suggestions

Feel free to create new github issues or just causally send me an email. 

For crashes, it would be most helpful if you could replicate the crash and capture the error from cli output.

For suggestions, I may or may not choose to impliment what you describe. Explaining how a feature would be integraged would be more helpful than vauge ideas. Design concepts would be great, but you should check with me before investing too much time into it.

### Code Contributions

The current code base is very (very) messy, as such I don't expect any code contributions. 

If you really want to contribute code you should message me about what you want to work on beforehand.

## Possible contribution projects

- Website design.
- Icon design and branding.
- Gstreamer backend.
- UI concepts.
