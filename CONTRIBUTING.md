### Welcome

Thanks for your interest in Tauon Music Box. With your help we might be able to make this an actually good player.

### Bug reports

Currently, releases are only a small step above development screenshots in terms of stability and undergo little testing,
so encountering issues are likely. If you would like to submit a bug report, you can use the issue tracker here on the Github page.

This is a small project so no need to be too formal, though it would be helpful to include the following:

1) Your OS and desktop environment
2) Description of the issue
3) Steps to reproduce the issue if applicable

If the issue is a crash and you're running in Linux, it would be super helpful if you could also get the error message / traceback from running from the terminal.
(e.g. run using "python3 /opt/tauon-music-box/tauon.py")

### Feature requests

Feel free to use the issue tracker for these as well. Although I don't guarantee it will be accepted.

To help pose a stronger argument, try to describe the specific use case surrounding the requested feature.

### Feedback / Suggestions / Other

You could use the issue tracker if suitable or contact me directly.

## Core contributions

I don't expect anyone to want to contribute since this program is a giant pile of spaghetti code and a complete mess.
Trying to understand it from scratch would be a nightmare.

But if you realllyyy want to contribute, the following could be helpful. Best to talk to me about it first.

 - Concepts (like for the user interface etc, though, try to understand the design direction of the existing one first)
 - Site design / branding and graphics
 - Gstreamer experts (It might be nice to bring the gstreamer backend to feature parity with the current BASS backend to make the program fully free software)
 - Themes (if you made a good one)
