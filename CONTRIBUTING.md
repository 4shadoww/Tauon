# Contributing to Tauon Music Box



### Issues & Suggestions

Feel free to create new github issues or just causally send me an email. 

For crashes, it would be most helpful if you could replicate the crash and capture the error from cli output.

  > To run manually for standard install `python3 /opt/tauon-music-box/tauon.py` or for flatpak install ...? (I forgot how you do this)

For suggestions, I may or may not choose to impliment what you describe. Explaining how a feature would be integraged would be more helpful than vauge ideas. Design concepts would be great, but you should check with me before investing too much time into it.

### Translations

There are currently no translations available. But you can contibute one if you like.

The translation framework used is gettext. Contact me or open an issue and I can give you a `.po` file to translate.

Not all strings are marked for translation yet. Language will be detected based on locale environment variables. Only left to right text is supported at this time.

### Code Contributions

The current code base is very (very) messy, as such I don't expect any code contributions. 

If you really want to contribute code you should message me about what you want to work on beforehand.

## Possible contribution projects

- Website design.
- Icon design and branding.
- Gstreamer backend.
- UI concepts.
