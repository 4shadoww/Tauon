## Download and Install :dizzy:

For __Arch Linux__ based distros, install is avaliable from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tauon-music-box/).

For __Other Linux distributions__, a **Flatpak** package is available.

<a href='https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.taiko2k.tauonmb'><img width='240' alt='Download on Flathub' src='https://flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.png'/></a>

  > **Upgrading note:** If you are upgrading from the old standalone flatpak package that was previously provided, make sure to uninstall it first, use `sudo flatpak uninstall com.github.taiko2k.tauonmb`. Default permissions are now more restricted, if some functions no longer work, see [Flatpak Permissions](https://github.com/Taiko2k/TauonMusicBox/wiki/Flatpak-Permissions).
